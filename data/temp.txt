The supranational authority of the European Court of Human Rights bypasses the nation state in a growing number of other areas. Understanding the evolution of the ECHR and its Court may help in explaining and contextualising growing resistance against the Court, and in developing possible responses. Examining the Convention system through the prism of supranationality, Cedric Marti offers a fresh, comprehensive and interdisciplinary perspective on the expanding adjudicatory powers of the Court, including law-making. Marti addresses the growing literature of institutional studies on human rights enforcement to ascertain the particularities of the ECHR and its relationship to domestic legal systems. This study will be of great value to both scholars of international law and human rights

Within the world of the comic strip, information, information behavior, and the exchange of information play a key role in helping build and maintain community among the (mostly lesbian) characters. In turn, the identities of the individual members of that community are shaped by that evolving community. This essay will use Jaeger and Burnett\u2019s theory of information worlds as a framework for examining how information and information behaviors help to form and maintain the information world of the lesbian community depicted in <italic>Dykes To Watch Out For<\/italic>. It will demonstrate that, as an insider in a marginalized community, Bechdel framed the information world of that community through her art and exported it to other communities outside of her world, thus helping to shape the information worlds of \u201creal-world\u201d lesbian communities over the quarter century that the strip was published.<\/p>","DOI":"10.14325\/mississippi\/9781496825773.003.0016","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,18]],"date-time":"2020-09-18T06:27:34Z","timestamp":1600410454000},"page":"230-244","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Framing Community from Inside Out"],"prefix":"10.14325","author":[{"given":"Don L.","family":"Latham","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jonathan M.","family":"Hollister","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"5425","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,17]]},"container-title":["The Comics of Alison Bechdel"],"original-title":["Framing Community from Inside Out"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,18]],"date-time":"2020-09-18T06:27:35Z","timestamp":1600410455000},"score":18.542465,"subtitle":["The Information Worlds of Dykes to Watch Out For"],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,30]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.14325\/mississippi\/9781496825773.003.0016","relation":{"is-identical-to":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.2307\/j.ctvx5w9fh.20","asserted-by":"subject"}]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,30]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,19]],"date-time":"2021-12-19T12:52:15Z","timestamp":1639918335916},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","issue":"3","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[1977,5,1]],"date-time":"1977-05-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":231292800000},"content-version":"tdm","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/tdm"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[1977,5]]},"DOI":"10.3758\/bf03202233","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,1,23]],"date-time":"2011-01-23T19:45:39Z","timestamp":1295811939000},"page":"274-276","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["An interface system for asynchronous data"],"prefix":"10.3758","volume":"9","author":[{"given":"A.

For this introduction, we define the community aspect of exclusion as the unintended reduction of participation in local life and spatial aspects of exclusion as the unintended reduction of mobility outside and inside of a person\u2019s home. Fighting against social exclusion of older adults is a priority due to the negative effects of exclusion on older adults\u2019 quality of life as well as on the equity and cohesion of an ageing society as a whole (adapted from Levitas et al. 2007 in Walsh et al. 2017, p. 83). Place, as a socio-spatial phenomenon, can shape older adults\u2019 lives and their experiences of social exclusion. It encompasses dimensions such as social and relational aspects of place, amenities and build environment, place-based policy and experiential belonging. The purpose of this chapter is to briefly introduce some allied concepts related to older people\u2019s relationship with their place and environment, and broadly illustrate the relevance of this relationship to old-age social exclusion. The chapter closes with a short introduction to each contribution within this section.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-51406-8_14","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,30]],"date-time":"2021-03-30T09:02:59Z","timestamp":1617094979000},"page":"185-191","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Introduction: Framing Community and Spatial Exclusion"],"prefix":"10.1007","author":[{"given":"Isabelle","family":"Tournier","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lucie","family":"Vidovi\u0107ov\u00e1","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,31]]},"reference":[{"key":"14_CR1","unstructured":"Alzheimer Europe.
